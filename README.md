# JSONRepository
A repository to store and host static JSON data, mostly for Android practicum subjects. This exists as a replacement to the short-lived myjson.com, may she rest in peace.

## Naming Convention

**AAAAAA-TITLE.json**, where:

`AAAA` => Case Code (e.g O202-MOBI6006-RM01-00)

`TITLE` => the Title of the case (e.g DotaMarketplace)

The result should be `O202-MOBI6006-RM01-00-DotaMarketplace.json`
